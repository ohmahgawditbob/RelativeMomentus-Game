# I'm not into those hideously long licenses
Just dont steal this, break copyright law and stuff. You're a github user, you probably already know this stuff anyways. If you do steal it, I can use this license, since it says that this is ©2018 Relative Momentus Group. So... Ha! No stealy stealy!

©2018 Relative Momentus Group

The relative momentus group may not even work on that... hm, oh well. Nobody reads the license.md anyways. But yeah, just don't steal it and stuff and you wont get sued and stuff.

# Abstract
  Oh wait, the abstract is supposed to be first. I suppose it's such a short license that it'll be visible anyways. But just don't steal it. You can help me with it through Github if you are accessing the repository. And also don't steal this license please, I worked very hard on it, just like I have worked hard on my game. Just don't steal either of them, and you'll be fine. And don't modify the game into something I wouldn't recognize or approve of. Don't turn this into something that is above G rating. I'm going for a good, fun game.
